# Hello Pulse Project Overhaul: Comprehensive Summary

## Project Overview

Hello Pulse is a collaborative brainstorming platform powered by artificial intelligence. The project aims to provide a comprehensive solution for team collaboration with integrated AI capabilities. The platform features user management, organization management, project collaboration, event scheduling, and AI-assisted content generation.

Our current goal has been to restructure and rebuild the backend of the Hello Pulse platform. The original codebase lacked clear separation of concerns and proper architectural patterns, making it difficult to maintain and extend. We have undertaken a significant refactoring effort to implement a domain-driven design approach with a cleaner, more maintainable architecture.

## Original Codebase Analysis

The original Hello Pulse backend was implemented in Go but suffered from several architectural issues:

1. Lack of clear separation between domains and responsibilities
2. Mixed business logic and data access code
3. Inconsistent error handling and validation
4. No clear service layer abstraction
5. Limited testability due to tight coupling
6. Incomplete domain models with implicit relationships

The file structure was relatively flat, with models, database operations, and API handlers all at the same level, making it difficult to understand the system's organization.

## New Architecture Design

We designed a new architecture based on domain-driven design principles and clean architecture concepts:

1. **Domain-Oriented Structure**: Organized code by business domains (users, organizations, projects, events) rather than technical concerns
2. **Clear Layer Separation**:
   - Domain models (representing business entities)
   - Repositories (handling data access)
   - Services (implementing business logic)
   - API handlers (managing HTTP requests/responses)
3. **Infrastructure Separation**: Moved infrastructure concerns (database, storage, authentication) to dedicated packages
4. **Microservices Approach**: Designed for potential future decomposition into microservices

## Implementation Progress

### 1. Domain Models

We implemented core domain models for the primary business entities:

- **User Domain**: User accounts, authentication, and session management
- **Organization Domain**: Organizations, membership, and invite codes
- **Project Domain**: Projects, hierarchical project structure, and participants
- **Event Domain**: Scheduled events with participants and importance levels
- **File Domain**: File metadata for storage and retrieval

Each domain model includes appropriate relationships, validation logic, and database mappings.

### 2. Repository Layer

We created repositories to encapsulate data access logic:

- **User Repository**: User CRUD operations and queries
- **Auth Repository**: Session management and token validation
- **Organization Repository**: Organization management and membership
- **Project Repository**: Project hierarchy and participation management
- **Event Repository**: Event scheduling and participant management
- **Invite Repository**: Invitation code generation and validation

The repository pattern provides a clean abstraction over the database, making it easier to test and potentially change the underlying storage mechanism.

### 3. Service Layer

We implemented service components to handle business logic:

- **Auth Service**: Registration, login, session management
- **Organization Service**: Organization creation, joining, invite code generation
- **Project Service**: Project creation, hierarchy management, participant handling
- **Event Service**: Event scheduling, participant management, updates

The service layer orchestrates operations across multiple repositories and enforces business rules.

### 4. API Handlers

We developed API handlers to manage HTTP requests and responses:

- **Auth Handlers**: Registration, login, profile management
- **Organization Handlers**: Organization creation and joining
- **Project Handlers**: Project CRUD operations and participation
- **Event Handlers**: Event scheduling and management

API handlers focus on request validation, response formatting, and delegating business logic to services.

### 5. Infrastructure Setup

We configured Docker-based infrastructure for development and deployment:

- **PostgreSQL Database**: Using the pgvector extension for vector storage
- **MinIO Object Storage**: For file handling and storage
- **Nginx Proxy**: For routing and API gateway functionality
- **Backend Service**: Containerized Go application
- **Development Tools**: pgAdmin for database management

## Current Status

We have successfully implemented the core backend architecture with properly separated concerns and domain-driven design. The current implementation includes:

1. Complete domain models for all business entities
2. Repository implementations for data access
3. Service implementations for core business logic
4. API handlers for necessary endpoints
5. Docker configuration for local development and testing

We encountered and resolved some issues with Docker configuration, particularly around building and running the Go application in a containerized environment.

## Next Steps

The following steps are planned to complete the backend implementation:

1. **Storage Implementation**: Integrate MinIO for file storage and management
2. **AI Service Integration**: Implement the AI capabilities for content generation and analysis
3. **Testing**: Develop comprehensive unit and integration tests
4. **API Documentation**: Generate OpenAPI/Swagger documentation
5. **Frontend Integration**: Connect the existing or new frontend to the rebuilt backend
6. **Deployment Configuration**: Finalize production deployment setup

This refactoring effort provides a solid foundation for future development, making the codebase more maintainable, testable, and extensible as new features are added.
