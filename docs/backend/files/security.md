# Hello Pulse Security Enhancements

## Key Improvements

1. **Centralized Security Service**
   - Created a central `AuthorizationService` for all access control decisions
   - Consistent permissions checking across all resources (files, projects, events)
   - Explicit organization-based isolation for all resources

2. **Enhanced Middleware**
   - Security context enrichment middleware to add user and organization info
   - Resource ownership validation middleware for modification operations
   - Organization membership verification middleware
   - Admin privileges verification middleware

3. **Fine-grained Access Controls**
   - File access based on ownership, visibility, and organization membership
   - Project access limited to organization members and participants
   - Event access limited to organization members and participants
   - Admin-only operations properly protected

4. **Proper Multi-tenant Isolation**
   - All queries filter by organization ID
   - All repositories validate organization membership
   - Storage paths include organization IDs for isolation

5. **Standardized Error Handling**
   - Consistent security error types across the application
   - Clear distinction between "not found" and "access denied" errors
   - Status codes that protect information while being helpful

## Implementation Details

### Security Package
The new `pkg/security` package provides a centralized authorization service with methods for:
- Checking if a user can access a specific file
- Validating if a user can modify a resource
- Verifying organization membership
- Checking admin privileges

### Middleware Components
New middleware functions handle:
- Adding security context to each request
- Requiring organization membership for specific routes
- Restricting admin-only operations
- Validating resource ownership before modifications

### Repository Enhancements
Repository functions now include:
- Organization-scoped queries
- Methods that filter by both user and organization
- Functions to validate access across tenant boundaries

### Service Layer Updates
Service methods now:
- Validate user permissions before performing actions
- Check organization membership for all operations
- Handle security errors consistently

### Handler Updates
Handlers have been updated to:
- Use the security service for permission checks
- Map security errors to appropriate HTTP status codes
- Provide clear error messages that don't leak information

## Security Principles Applied

1. **Defense in Depth**
   - Security checks at multiple layers (middleware, service, repository)
   - Both client-side and server-side filtering

2. **Principle of Least Privilege**
   - Users can only access resources they need
   - Admin privileges required for system-wide operations

3. **Fail-Secure**
   - Default deny for access decisions
   - Explicit checks before any resource access

4. **Secure by Default**
   - All routes require authentication
   - Organization membership required for data access

5. **Complete Mediation**
   - Every access to a resource is checked
   - No direct access to storage without permission checks
